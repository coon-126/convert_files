Our format conversion software allows you to easily convert files from one format to another. 
However, to use our software, you must first install the required plugins: tkinter and moviepy. 
These plugins are necessary for the software to function properly and ensure that your files are converted accurately.

To install the plugins, follow these steps:
1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. Type the following command: pip install tkinter
3. Press enter and wait for the installation to finish.
4. Once tkinter is installed, type the following command: pip install moviepy
5. Press enter and wait for the installation to finish.

Once you have installed both plugins, you can open our format conversion software by running the main.py file.
This will launch the application, and you can begin converting your files with ease.
